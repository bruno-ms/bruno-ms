### Hello!

I'm a graduate student in Electrical Engineering at Federal University of Ceara. Last year I had my first contact with the data science world, and I was fascinated.
Since then, I've been studying Data Science topics, such as Machine Learning, Statistics and Data Analysis, in order to pursue an internship in this field.
